# tag-game
A 2D two player tag game

Driver file: Timber.cpp

This simple two-player tag game was a personal project of mine while I was learning C++ on my own. I intend to improve the design and implementation with my current knowledge.

Navigate the menus with your cursor. 
Press 'P' to pause while in game.

The goal of the game is to tag the opposing player as quickly as possible if you are it. 
While you are it, a bar will fill up, and after enough time as it (once bar is completely full), you lose!
